### The Code of Conduct

This project strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. As a result, the maintainers have agreed to and enforce this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of Buckler.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. It also includes the posting of sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Further, harassment includes ad-hominem attacks, grandstanding, derogatory comments, trolling, public or private community disruption, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Harassment is not tolerated in the issue tracker, code, events, chat channels, over emails, or any other way you can communicate with a contributor. Anyone who is asked to cease harassment is expected to comply immediately. Maintainers are not exempt from this policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, maintainers may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deleting comments, revoking access to the project, revoking access to communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please open an issue or contact a maintainer.
